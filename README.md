### Flip-Flop Switch Puzzle - README  

#### ðŸŽ¯ Objective  
Turn on all the lights by strategically toggling switches that behave like different types of flip-flops.  

#### ðŸŽ® Game Mechanics  
1. **Grid-Based Board**  
   - A 3x3 or 4x4 grid where each cell represents a switch connected to a light.  
   - Each switch follows flip-flop logic (T, D, SR, or JK flip-flop).  

2. **Types of Flip-Flops**  
   - **T Flip-Flop**: Toggles the light ON/OFF.  
   - **D Flip-Flop**: Copies the state of the previous switch.  
   - **SR Flip-Flop**: One button sets the light ON, another resets it OFF.  
   - **JK Flip-Flop**: Toggles when both inputs are active.  

3. **Rules**  
   - Clicking a switch changes the light state based on its flip-flop type.  
   - Some switches affect adjacent lights, adding complexity.  
   - The goal is to turn all lights ON.  

4. **Winning Condition**  
   - The game is won when all lights are ON.  

#### ðŸ”€ Variations  
- **Time Challenge**: Solve within a time limit.  
- **Limited Moves**: Complete the puzzle in a set number of clicks.  
- **Randomized Initial States**: Different ON/OFF light states for each level.
